## ðŸŽ¯ Special Feature - SFTP

The SFTP functionality of Termius lets you securely transfer files between two hosts, one of which can be your local device.
The SFTP interface consists of two panels, each of which allows you to browse and manage files on one of your hosts.
Transferring files between hosts can be done with drag-and-drop. 


## ðŸŽ¯ Special Feature - CLI Tool

The **Termius CLI (command line interface)** utility provides a method of interacting with Termius outside of the application itself. 
It is written in **Python** and can be installed on Linux, macOS, or Windows (via Windows Subsystem for Linux or Cygwin).
You can also use this utility to import, export, backup, and sync your SSH configuration on your machine to your Termius.com account. 
Using this functionality allows you to keep your SSH configuration in sync with Termius, providing maximum integration for software and tools that require **OpenSSH**.


## ðŸŽ¯ Observations

I've been using it for around a month, and I should say, the UI is pretty user friendly, and this pretty tool always offers something more than meets the eye.
For, CTF labs connection, this tool provides a seamless experience.
In addition, I found it has **dark mode** too!
